## OpenCV-ML


This is an iOS project that is using OpenCV library (C++). It contains the following popular machine learning cases:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Linearly Separable Data

- Support Vector Machines (SVM) for Non-Linearly Separable Data

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Unsupervised Machine Learning: Flat Clustering (using K-Means)


These are based on the tutorials provided by [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html)




#### Notes:

- The OpenCV framework used here has version 3.1



#### Setup:

- Before building the project in Xcode, please try first to un-zip the (large) file: opencv2.framework.zip


_There is more under development...._
